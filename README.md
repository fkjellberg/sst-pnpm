# Getting Started with Serverless Stack (SST)

This example is based on SST 2.19.0 and was created using the following command in a separate folder and then copied here:
```sh
% pnpm create sst rest-api
.../Library/pnpm/store/v3/tmp/dlx-44169  | +151 +++++++++++++++
Packages are hard linked from the content-addressable store to the virtual store.
  Content-addressable store is at: /Users/fkjellberg/Library/pnpm/store/v3
  Virtual store is at:             ../../../../Library/pnpm/store/v3/tmp/dlx-44169/node_modules/.pnpm
.../Library/pnpm/store/v3/tmp/dlx-44169  | Progress: resolved 151, reused 149, downloaded 2, added 151, done
âœ” Copied template files

Next steps:
- cd rest-api
- npm install (or pnpm install, or yarn)
- npm run dev
```

The `package.json` files have been updated to lock to a specific version of each dependency.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
% pnpm install
```

## Commands
